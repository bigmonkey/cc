	<h1>Why The Payday Hound?</h1>
							
		<h2>Why use The Payday Hound?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound is designed to help users make informed decisions about finding the best financial products suited for their use.</p>
		<p>We aim to be impartial and informed.  We strive to review every relevant card provider and every online payday lender in the market.</p>
		<p>We provide customized tools and concise analysis for users in a hurry to quickly find the best products at the same time we provide in-depth reviews and articles to help users with more time better understand the products and important features.</p>
		<p>The Payday Hound believes providing clear, honest information will create a better experience for both providers and consumers.</p>

		<h2>How do we make money?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound's reviews and rankings are free to users and the site is free of advertising. To keep this service free, we charge some product providers when users click through to the provider's site and either apply or are approved for loans. This sponsored provider relationship exists with less than 25% of the products listed. Showing unsponsored providers may hurt monetization, but we believe evaluating all providers regardless of financial relationship helps consumers make informed, better decisions regarding their financial product needs. We do not identify sponsored providers to ensure that a paid relationship is not interpreted as an endorsement. We believe if we provide honest and impartial reviews, users will continue to trust our reviews, and we’ll be able to make enough money to keep providing this service.</P></p>
		<p>If you know of a provider we don’t feature, please email us at <span class="code">&#109;&#111;&#099;&#046;&#100;&#110;&#117;&#111;&#104;&#121;&#097;&#100;&#121;&#097;&#112;&#101;&#104;&#116;&#064;&#107;&#099;&#097;&#098;&#100;&#101;&#101;&#102;</span>.</p>

		<h2>How do our Payday Loan rankings work?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound ranks each site based on a &#8220;Sniff Test,&#8221; pricing, and features.</p>
		<p>SNIFF TEST: Lenders score higher on the Sniff Test if they are licensed in each state in which they operate, have physical storefronts, are US based, display contact information, and have a privacy policy. The Sniff Test also incorporates Better Business Bureau ratings, accreditation and complaints.</p>
		<p>COST: Pricing is based on the cost of a $300, 14-day, payday loan in the State of Delaware.</p>
		<p>FEATURES: The Features sections located in each lender's individual review is based on features that differentiate lenders. For example, some lenders provide live chat or phone support, have applications in Spanish, or do not require references. Standard features, such as faxless applications and next business day funding only impact lenders if they do not provide these standard features.</p>

		<h2>How do our Secured Card rankings work?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound ranks each site based on pricing, and features.</p>
		<p>PRICING: Pricing includes annual fees, monthly fees, penalty fees and other fees. The Securec Card calculator creates a customized cost based on your usage. </p>
		<p>FEATURES: Cards receive better scores if they provide additional features like interest earning security deposits, free credit monitoring, or custom card designs. Cards receive lower scores if they charge hidden fees like fees for increasing your deposit, high monthly fees after the first year, or interest fees based on no grace periods.</p>
