  <h1>Payday and Installment Loans</h1> 
  	<p>Payday loans and installment loans are designed for short-term, emergency funding and can get cash into your checking account in 24 hours. These loans can be expensive so make sure to review all fees and terms before accepting a payday or installment loan.</p>
	<p>Paydayloans do not require credit checks and only require a simple application. To qualify you must be employed, have direct deposit and have a checking account. The application process takes 5-10 minutes and approval is often instant. The money can usually be deposited into your checking account by the next business day. Payday loans are due in full the next pay period. Installment loans are paid back over a longer period of time. See <%= link_to('Payday Loan or Installment Loan', "http://www.thepaydayhound.com/payday-loan-or-installment-loan/") %> for more details).</p>
